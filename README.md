# ClientAndServerApplications

This repisotory contains two applications to represent TCP/IP Client-Server architecture.  

The first one stands for a client application. It has ability to connect to the local server, send it messages and receive responce. 
The second application is a server itself. Each time client connects to the server a new thread starts, 
so it represents a multithreaded server. It has a basic functionality to get a message from client and send it back.
